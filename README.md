# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a self-proclaimed homebody who finds joy in the simple pleasures of life. When I'm not diving into the world of investments, you can find me binge-watching anime, catching up on the latest news, or getting lost in a good newspaper. My interests might seem eclectic, but they all keep me grounded and constantly learning. Welcome to my GitHub!
